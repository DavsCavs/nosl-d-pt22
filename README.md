### My Baltic Car


My project is a website where you can check active listings of used cars from Baltic's biggest used car marketplaces. Main problem my site solves, is that we young people usually after getting drivers license want to buy a car. And for us who lives in Baltic's there is no problem to drive and get our car in neighbor country.
